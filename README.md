# OpenDub ðŸ¥¥

**OpenDub** is a powerful tool for generating translated dialogues from subtitles while preserving the original voice. It utilizes speech recognition, machine translation, and voice cloning technologies to ensure that the translated dialogue stays in sync with the original audio. Perfect for projects in film, media, or any context where translated content needs to maintain the integrity of the speakerâ€™s voice.

## Features

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):** Extracts text from original audio files.
- **Subtitle Translation:** Translates text from one language to another with high accuracy.
- **Voice Cloning:** Synthesizes the translated dialogue using the original speaker's voice.
- **Subtitle Synchronization:** Ensures the translated audio matches the original subtitle timings.

## How It Works

1. **Audio to Text Conversion**: The original audio is processed using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to extract dialogue in the source language.
2. **Subtitle Translation**: The extracted text or subtitle file is translated into the target language using a powerful machine translation engine.
3. **Voice Cloning**: The system clones the speakerâ€™s voice using advanced TTS (Text-to-Speech) with voice cloning capabilities.

## How To Run

#### Install Dependencies: In your virtual environment, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Place Test Files:

Put a Spanish audio file in `src/audio/input_audio.wav`.
Place the matching Spanish subtitle file in `src/subtitles/input_subtitles.srt`.
#### Run the Application: Execute the main script to run the entire pipeline:

```bash
python app.py
```
#### Output: The dubbed audio will be saved in the `src/output/output_audio.wav` file.


## Differentiation of OpenDub

**OpenDub** can differentiate itself from existing dubbing projects in several ways:

### 1. Open Source Approach
- **Accessibility**: Being open-source allows developers and users to modify, improve, and contribute to the project, fostering a community-driven environment.
- **Transparency**: Users can inspect the code, ensuring no hidden features or unfair usage policies.

### 2. User-Centric Customization
- **Custom Voice Cloning**: Allow users to create and upload their own voice models, ensuring that the dubbing matches specific vocal characteristics.
- **Fine-Tuning Translation**: Enable users to adjust translations for cultural nuances or colloquialisms, making the output more natural and relatable.

### 3. Enhanced Synchronization Techniques
- **Adaptive Lip Syncing**: Utilize advanced algorithms that analyze video frames to generate more accurate lip sync for dubbed audio.
- **Timing Adjustments**: Implement tools that allow users to manually adjust timing in cases where automatic synchronization may falter.

### 4. Multi-Modal Input
- **Support for Different Media Types**: Accept not just video files, but also live streams, animations, and even text-based scripts.
- **Real-Time Dubbing**: Enable live dubbing capabilities for events, webinars, or gaming streams.

### 5. Integration with Other Tools
- **APIs for Third-Party Services**: Allow integration with existing platforms for subtitles, translations, or video editing, enhancing the workflow.
- **Plugins for Popular Video Editors**: Create plugins for software like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro to facilitate easy dubbing within the editing process.

### 6. Multi-Language and Dialect Support
- **Wider Language Base**: Focus on languages and dialects that are often underrepresented in dubbing technologies, catering to niche markets.
- **Cross-Cultural Features**: Include local accents or variations within a language to make the dubbing more authentic.

### 7. Advanced AI and ML Techniques
- **Emotion Recognition**: Use AI to analyze the emotional tone of the original dialogue and replicate it in the dubbed audio.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Implement NLP techniques to ensure that translations are contextually relevant, making the dialogues sound more natural.

### 8. Educational Tools
- **Language Learning Features**: Incorporate tools for learners, such as side-by-side translations or pronunciation guides, making it a dual-purpose platform.
- **Use in E-Learning**: Partner with educational institutions to provide dubbing for instructional videos, making learning materials accessible to a broader audience.

### 9. Focus on Ethical Practices
- **Respect for Copyright**: Provide clear guidelines on how to use the dubbing technology responsibly, respecting the rights of original content creators.
- **Inclusive Representation**: Ensure that voice options and content are diverse and represent various cultures fairly.
